# CPSC4830-midterm1
The first midterm of CPSC4830 where we use techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, PCA and linear regression.

In question 1 we try to predict the outcome of message, to see if it SPAM or HAM. We do this with two approaches:
  1. With a Logistic Regression model
  2. With a Random Forest Classifier model

In question 2 we create a linear regression model to predict the energy consumption of a steel factory. We use PCA to reduce the dimensions.
